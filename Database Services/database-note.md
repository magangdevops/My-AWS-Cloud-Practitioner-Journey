## What is a Database?
* A database is an organized collection of data that enables efficient storage, retrieval, andmanagement of information. Databases can be relational or non-relational, depending on data structure needs.

## Examples of Relational(SQL) Databases
* Amazon Relational Database Service -> handles provisioning, pacthing, backup, recovery and scaling.
* Amazon Aurora -> high perfomance, highly available and scalable MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
* Amazon Readshift -> petabyte-scale data warehouse service designed for analytical processing(OLAP).

## Examples of Non-Relational(NoSQL) Databases
* Amazon DynamoDB -> high-speed lookups of value by a unique key.

### Document Databases
* Amazon DocumentDB -> Store and query data as JSON-like documents.

### In-Memory Databases
* Amazon ElastiCache -> Caching, Session Store Microsecond latency for caching.
* Amazon MemoryDB-> A durable Redis-compatible database not just a cache.

### Graph Databases
* Amazon Neptune -> Relationship-Heavy Data Efficiently navigates complex relationships.

### Wide-Column Databases
* Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) -> Store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. Good for large-scale, sparse datasets.

### Specialized Data Stores
* Amazon Timestream -> For IoT device telemetry, application monitoring and industrial telemetry where you query and analyze time-stamped data.
* Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)-> Provides an immutable, transparent and cryptographically verifiable transaction log. 
* Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)-> An in-memory cache specifically for DynamoDB, offering microsecond read latency.
