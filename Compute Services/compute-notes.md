## What is Compute ?
* Compute is the processing power that lets your application run. In the cloud, this usually refers to virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

### Examples of Core AWS Compute  Services
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) -> virtual server in the cloud.
* AWS Lambda -> serverless compute(runs code without managing servers)
* Amazon Elastic Container Service -> fully managed container orchestration service.
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service -> runs kubernnetes workload without managing the control plane etc.
* AWS Fargate -> serverless service for containers.
* Amazon Lightsail -> simplified cloud platform with easy to use virtual servers.

### Examples of Specialised Compute Services
* AWS Batch Processing -> runs batch computing workloads at large scale.
* Amazon Elastic Beanstalk ->deploy applications quickly without worrying about infrustructure.
* AWS Outposts -> run AWS services on-premises with the same AWS Infraustructure and API's.
